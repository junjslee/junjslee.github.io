## Configuration
### Github Secrets
When deploying via GitHub Actions, add any sensitive environment variables as repository secrets:
- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
- Click New repository secret and add secrets like EMAILJS_USER_ID.

## Deployment Options
Two GitHub Pages deployment options:
### Deploy as a Project Site
- URL Structure:
   - Your site will be available at https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name.
- Configuration:
   - In next.config.js, you should set a basePath and assetPrefix:
   ```js
   // next.config.js (for project site deployment)
   const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

   const nextConfig = {
   reactStrictMode: true,
   output: 'export',
   trailingSlash: true,
   basePath: isProd ? '/your-repo-name' : '',
   assetPrefix: isProd ? '/your-repo-name/' : '',
   };
   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```
### Deploy as a User Site
- URL Structure
   - Rename the repository to yourusername.github.io so your site is available at https://yourusername.github.io.
- Configuration:
   - Remove or conditionally disable basePath and assetPrefix in next.config.js:
   ```js
   // next.config.js (for user site deployment)
   const nextConfig = {
   reactStrictMode: true,
   output: 'export',
   trailingSlash: true,
   basePath: '',
   assetPrefix: '',
   };
   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```
## Github Actions
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/nextjs.yml) that automatically builds and deploys your site when you push to the main branch.

Ensure the workflowâ€™s configuration matches your deployment option and that any necessary secrets are configured.

## Usage
After installation and configuration:
- Run npm run dev for local development.
- Run npm run build to generate static files in the out folder.
- Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions for automatic deployment.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the following:
- Content: Update the text in Hero.tsx, AboutSection.tsx, ResumeSection.tsx, etc.
- Styling: Modify Tailwind CSS classes in your components or update the theme in tailwind.config.js.
- Components: Add or remove sections as needed.
- Environment Variables: Adjust or add new variables for additional services.
